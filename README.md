data-structures
==========

<b>Written by:</b> Tony Andrys

A collection of various data structures and algorithms implemeneted in Java. Built primarily as an educational exercise for myself, perhaps they can be useful to others as well.

I have tried to write these implementations with a generous amount of comments and included asymptotic time complexity measurements where necessary. For now, these are primarily upper/lower bounds (Big Oh/Omega).

Feel free to use the code in this repository in any matter you see fit-- but please include credit to the author if you choose to republish.

*Please note that all implementations only support integers. I'll get around to changing this soon.*
